# MManaging Data With the SDK

In this project, we will use the SDK to upload and register a dataset, and then retrieve some simple data from it.

## Steps

1. Run script *scripts\Workspace_create.ps1* in order to make sure Authentication is enabled, to prevent unauthorized access.

2. Create the dataset and upload **nba-2017-players-with-salary-wiki-twitter.csv**

3. Explore the data
